    1.  The table must have an initial header row with exactly this
        structure, and the <tbody> is omitted because we insert rows

    2.  These buttons call our two global functions addLine() and calculate().
        Because we load script.js at the end of the body, they will be defined
        by the time the user clicks them.

    3.  This <pre> is where the text‐report will appear.

  <!--
    5.  Finally, we load our script.js at the very end of the body,
        so that `addLine()` and `calculate()` exist by the time the
        buttons are clicked.
